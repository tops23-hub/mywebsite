			Historical beginnings of mohobelo<br><br>


The beginnings of mohobelo trace back to the period following the Lifaqane wars and the Great Trek.<br>
 In the late 1800s, despite the fact that much of the turmoil had calmed down, Basotho men continued <br>
 to protect outposts in the Maluti Mountains. They would engage in this for days continuously,<br>
 dedicating their time to singing, and over time, they started to include lively movements to complement<br>
 their voices. This occurred while attired in complete warrior gear – a blanket, shield, spear, or<br> 
 knobkerrie (club) – and they started to utilize these weapons to highlight the power of their actions.<br><br><br>

During this process, a fresh genre of dance music called mohobelo emerged within the Ha-Molapo community<br>
in the northern district of Leribe. Vocally a blend of mokorotlo (war songs) and lelingoane or<br>
 mangae (initiation school chants), with significant praise-poetry elements, mohobelo is a dance of strides,<br>
 slides, and leaps solely executed by Basotho men. While it has territorial characteristics, as the dance styles <br>
 in the north vary from those in the south, it fundamentally serves as a demonstration of masculinity <br>
 with a naturally competitive element.<br><br><br>

Village leaders quickly understood that the energy of mohobelo could be utilized effectively,<br>
so community work teams (letsema) started incorporating the dance to invigorate<br>
 laborers during plowing and ho-pola (the process of harvesting wheat, millet, or corn). Historically,<br>
 women prepared beer and meals for the men laboring in the fields, incorporating ululations into the tunes and beats<br>
 of the mohobelo performers<br><br><br>


When a man sought to move to a new village, it became a tradition for him to bring his koto (knob) to acquire land. <br>
This would grant him the title of oa hoba, symbolizing his dedication to protect the village<br>
during difficult times and to assist in cultivating the land and participating in the customs of mohobelo.<br>
