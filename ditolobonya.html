			<b> The history of litolobonya </b>

<br><br>
Lesotho has a rich cultural heritage as the birthplace of many musical genres.<br>
 Although some of these have become extinct over the years, the genre and cultural practice <br>
 known as litolobonya has endured. Litolobonya is a form of song and dance exclusively for girls<br>
 and married women. The girl's version of litolobonya is performed in the open, where everyone may watch,<br> 
 but the version for women is highly secretive and is performed only by those who have given live birth[1].<br>
The women's version of litolobonya is performed at social events called pitiki: the celebrations that<br> 
follow the birth of a child. To this day, and under threat of punishment, men are forbidden to <br>
enter any house or venue where women are performing the dance. The main instruments used in litolobonya<br>
 music are the sekupu (a drum made of cowhide stretched over a 20-litre tin) and a whistle. Strictly,<br>
 every performer has to wear thethana (a traditional skirt made of fibre and beads) and other forms of<br>
 attire, which may differ by region[2].<br><br><br>
 
 
The music is exclusive to women because it gives them a platform, at the onset of motherhood,<br>
to express their sexuality and share their innermost concerns with other women without fear of being judged. In addition, <br>
the genre is still used as a tool to empower newly married women, giving them tips on family management <br>
and how to cope with the strenuous nature of family life. In this way, litolobonya music functions as an <br>
important cultural practice, a way of transmitting knowledge and wisdom from one generation to the next<br>
and influencing the mores and values of the community[3].<br><br><br>
Decline in the 1990s and resurgence in the 2000s<br>
Although litolobonya has never been a form of popular music, changing social attitudes <br>
in Lesotho have influenced the prevalence of the cultural practice in the country. From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s,<br>
litolobonya music saw a decline, as it came to be perceived as ‘backward’ and an activity for ‘rural’ women only. With the widespread <br>
uptake of Christianity in Lesotho, some even regarded the tradition as ‘pagan’ and some men would prohibit their wives<br>
 from taking part in the litolobonya ritual. There are folksongs from this period composed by women pleading with their<br>
 husbands and in-laws to allow them to join litolobonya groups[4].<br>
However, a strong cultural reawakening – motivated by growing divorce rates and fears about ‘moral degeneration’ – <br>
led to the revival of litolobonya, which came to be considered as a possible remedy to social ills. Since the early 2000s,<br>
the revival has been significant: a practice that was maligned has once again been embraced by the majority of Basotho women.<br><br><br>

 Interestingly, the most successful pitiki groups in Lesotho are now often led by educated businesswomen. The tradition is now <br>
seen as a powerful platform for women to address their marital problems and as a valuable support network where most of the songs <br>
are about the problems that married and single mothers face on a daily basis. Women gather at local halls to watch concerts by <br>
local litolobonya groups, and these spaces have thrown a lifeline to many unemployed women by giving them chance to earn a living[5].<br><br><br>


At the time of writing (2018-19), there is a market for litolobonya performances in both rural and urban areas of Lesotho, and local<br>
radio stations play an important role in advertising and promoting these women-only social gatherings. The rise of these litolobonya<br>
 groups has also strengthened the position of Basotho women in the workplace, creating <br><br><br>

related sources of employment (such as the manufacturing of club-affiliated blankets and other accessories)<br>
 and providing additional labour-related support in the form of emergency medical funds and funeral plans for group members[6]. <br>
Schools have also played a pivotal role in resuscitating litolobonya music. Schools throughout Lesotho now hold Cultural<br>
Days where traditional music is performed. A key feature of these celebrations is the performance of the girls’ version of the<br>
 litolobonya dance[7].
