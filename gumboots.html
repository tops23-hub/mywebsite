			Gumboots: A History <br><br>
Gumboot dancing was born in the gold mines of South Africa at the height of the migrant<br>
labour system and during the oppressive Apartheid Pass Laws.<br>
The mine workers were not free to move around at will and were separated from their<br>
families for long periods of time. At best, working in the mines was a long, hard,<br>
repetitive toil. At worst, the men would be taken chained into the mines and shackled at<br>
their work stations in almost total darkness.<br><br><br>
The floors of the mines were often flooded, with poor or non-existent drainage. For the<br>
miners, hours of standing up to their knees in infected waters brought on skin ulcers,<br>
foot problems and consequent lost work time. The bosses discovered that providing<br>
gumboots (Wellington boots) to the workers was cheaper than attempting to drain the<br>
mines. This created the miners uniform, consisting of heavy black Wellington boots,<br>
jeans, bare chest and bandannas to absorb eye-stinging sweat.<br><br>
The workers were forbidden to speak, and as a result created a means of<br>
communication, essentially their own unique form of Morse Code. By slapping their<br>
gumboots and rattling their ankle chains, the enslaved workers sent messages to each<br>
other in the darkness. From this came an entertainment, as the miners evolved their<br>
percussive sounds and movements into a unique dance form and used it to entertain<br>
each other during their free time.<br><br><br>
Gumboot dancing has developed into a working class, South African art form with a<br>
universal appeal. The dancers expand upon traditional steps, with the addition of<br>
contemporary movement, music and song. Extremely physical, the dancing serves as a<br>
cathartic release, celebrating the body as an instrument, and the richness and<br>
complexities of South African culture.<br><br><br>
GUMBOOT DANCING IN SOWETO<br>
In 1974, Mrs M Makhudu formed the Thabisong Youth Club in Soweto, with the purpose<br>
of bringing youth off the streets to learn about the ways of their people and to teach<br>
them some of the traditional tribal dance which was gradually being lost. Many forms of<br>
dance were taught to the young people, including the unique South African dance bred<br>
out of the hardship of working in the mines, the Gumboot Dance.<br><br><br>
Members of the youth club went on to form the Rishile Poets, who performed songs and<br>
poetry around the townships of Soweto to nearly 15,000 people in two years. This<br>
company eventually became the Rishile Traditional Dancers in 1990 and then the Rishile<br>
Gumboot Dancers of Soweto, combining the magical African rhythms of song and poetry<br>
with the excitement and exhilaration of the Gumboot Dance.<br>
Zenzi Mbuli (Director) and Tale Motsepe of Future Artists Empowerment then<br>
consolidated the group to form a top performance ensemble, performing such numbers<br>
as the haunting Mabele and the surprising I'm Too Sexy. For the next two years, the<br>
company toured the community festival circuit in South Africa, and then went on to tour<br>
the international festival circuit performing in Australia, Belgium and South East Asia.<br>
In 1998, Zenzi, Tale and the Rishile members began working in partnership with SFX<br>
Back Row, Fifth Amendment, and Columbia Artists Theatricals, Inc to create a new<br>
version of their show, GUMBOOTS.<br><br><br>
GUMBOOTS premiered at the Standard Bank National Arts Festival in Grahamstown,<br>
South Africa on June 29, 1999. The production sold out within days, earning standing<br>
ovations at every performance.<br><br><br>
Since then the production has successfully toured the UK and North America; Following<br>
its UK premiere at the 1999 Edinburgh Festival, GUMBOOTS embarked on a nation-al<br>
tour of the UK including a three week engagement at the Lyric Theatre in London's West<br>
End. It then played to great critical acclaim in venues across North America, including an<br>
extended sell out run at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal.<br>
